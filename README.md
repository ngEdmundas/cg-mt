Question
Maximum time to find a solution : 120:00
You have been chosen to launch a cyber attack aimed at destabilizing a small group of USB missile launcher dealers. In order to finance their illegal activities, these thugs managed to collect a considerable quantity of Brouzoufs (local currency) by infiltrating millions of software developers’ corporate networks. IT projects all over the world have been delayed and open-plan offices are under maximum pressure. The global software industry is now threatened. 

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to restore order by launching a full-frontal assault against the traffickers’ bank account. The strategy to be implemented is to literally empty their bank account by carrying out financial transactions to an external bank account, in order to obtain the complete destruction of the traffickers’ financial strength. 

You will be given bank account numbers at the last minute. 

Mission #1: Detecting a security breach in the PayPaul system
The first stage of your mission involves identifying a security breach in the online banking system provided by the PayPaul company, a global leader in online payment solutions. To do so, only limited information is available: 

1. A listing containing some transaction data stolen from PayPaul:

ACCOUNT TO DEBIT (D)	ACCOUNT TO CREDIT (C)	PRIVATE KEY (K)
374c5a446f	5872303531	7LZDoXr051
6339314b67	4c48483673	c91KgLHH6s
356e5a7263	4841473737	5nZrcHAG77
2. A technical paper also robbed from PayPaul:

??? Document that describes server.com:9999 as the bank endpoint.


Mission #2 : Transferring a maximum amount of Brouzoufs in a minimum amount of time.

To succeed in your mission you must, without fail, keep the following points in mind:

So that PayPaul’s security is not be alerted, each transaction amount shall not exceed 5000 Brouzoufs.
Once you have been transmitted the bank account numbers, you will have no more than 1 second to conduct transactions!
The time needed from when you launch a transaction to when the transaction is completed is about 600 milliseconds (network exchanges + server data processing)
According to our informants, there would be 25000 Brouzoufs on the trafficker’s bank account. To put an end to their fraudulent trade for good, you must try to extort all the money from them.
Implement the method start(String accSource, String accTarget) which will be the starting point of your program (do not modify the signature of this method).

The future of the IT industry is at stake: ensuring that your program will work when needed is therefore crucial. To succeed, you may practice as often as you wish from the bank account numbers which are given in the test editor.

Good luck!
